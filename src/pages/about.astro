        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          "Two Kinds" is a fun exploration of the countless dualities that exist in our world. From
          contrasting approaches to everyday tasks to opposing philosophies about life, technology,
          or nature—these simple dichotomies often reveal fascinating patterns in how things work,
          how we think, and how we interact with our environment.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This project collects and showcases these dualities, inviting visitors to reflect on which
          patterns they recognize and perhaps discover something new about the world around them.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform allows users to browse, create, and share "sayings" about the two kinds of
          anything in the world. Each saying follows a simple format: an introduction followed by
          two contrasting elements, approaches, or characteristics.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          For example: "There are two kinds of people in the world: those who make their bed every
          morning, and those who see no point since they'll just mess it up again tonight."
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Or: "There are two kinds of programming languages: those everyone complains about and
          those nobody uses."
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Or even: "There are two kinds of cats: those who knock things off tables while looking you
          directly in the eye, and those who wait until you leave the room."
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Users can browse sayings by category, like them to show appreciation, and even filter by
          popularity or recency.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How to Contribute</h2>
        <p>Contributing your own observation is easy:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>Create an account or sign in with your preferred method</li>
          <li>Navigate to the "Create" page</li>
          <li>Choose an introduction phrase (or create your own)</li>
          <li>Select a category for your saying</li>
          <li>Describe the two kinds you've observed</li>
          <li>Submit your creation to share it with the world</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-6">
          The best sayings are those that highlight interesting contrasts we all recognize but
          rarely discuss. They should be relatable, thoughtful, and ideally make people smile with
          recognition—whether they're about people, animals, objects, or abstract concepts.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Community</h2>
        <p>
          Two Kinds is more than just a collection of observations—it's a growing community of
          people who enjoy thinking about the patterns and contrasts that shape our world. We
          encourage respectful, good-humored contributions that celebrate these dualities rather
          than judging them.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-8 italic">
          Join us in exploring these lighthearted divisions and maybe even contribute your own
          observation about the two kinds of anything in this world!
