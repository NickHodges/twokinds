          "Two Kinds of People" is a fun exploration of the countless ways humanity divides itself
          into dualities. From the way we squeeze toothpaste to how we organize our digital files,
          these simple choices often reveal fascinating aspects of our personalities.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This project collects and showcases these dualities, inviting visitors to reflect on which
          camp they fall into and perhaps discover something new about themselves and others along
          the way.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Join us in exploring these lighthearted divisions and maybe even contribute your own
          observation about the two kinds of people in this world.
