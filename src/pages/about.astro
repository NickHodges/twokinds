        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          "Two Kinds of People" is a fun exploration of the countless ways humanity divides itself
          into dualities. From the way we squeeze toothpaste to how we organize our digital files,
          these simple choices often reveal fascinating aspects of our personalities.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This project collects and showcases these dualities, inviting visitors to reflect on which
          camp they fall into and perhaps discover something new about themselves and others along
          the way.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform allows users to browse, create, and share "sayings" about the two kinds of people in the world.
          Each saying follows a simple format: an introduction followed by two contrasting behaviors or preferences.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          For example: "There are two kinds of people in the world: those who make their bed every morning, and those who see no point since they'll just mess it up again tonight."
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Users can browse sayings by category, like them to show appreciation, and even filter by popularity or recency.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How to Contribute</h2>
        <p>
          Contributing your own observation is easy:
        </p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>Create an account or sign in with your preferred method</li>
          <li>Navigate to the "Create" page</li>
          <li>Choose an introduction phrase (or create your own)</li>
          <li>Select a category for your saying</li>
          <li>Describe the two kinds of people you've observed</li>
          <li>Submit your creation to share it with the world</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="mt-6">
          The best sayings are those that highlight everyday choices we all make but rarely discuss. They should be relatable, thoughtful, and ideally make people smile with recognition.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Community</h2>
        <p>
          Two Kinds of People is more than just a collection of observationsâ€”it's a growing community of people who enjoy thinking about the small choices that make us who we are. We encourage respectful, good-humored contributions that celebrate our differences rather than judging them.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-8 italic">
          Join us in exploring these lighthearted divisions and maybe even contribute your own
          observation about the two kinds of people in this world!
